Build a lightweight automation framework that can be used to write API Automation test cases fast and assert them easily.

There should be one directory that should contain all the endpoints in the form of `.json` as described below.
```
├── src
│   ├── endpoints               → directory which contains all the endpoints
|   │   ├── getUsers.json       → Request json file to get all the users endpoint
|   │   ├── getSingleUser.json  → Request json file to get a single user endpoint
|   |   └── createUser.json     → Request json file to create a  new user
```
Example endpoints json files are attached under the `endpoints/` directory.


- Framework should be able to test all the endpoint one by one under the `endpoints/*` directory
- Every assertions mentioned in `endpoints/**.json` file should be asserted



- Framework should be able to generate request **dynamically** based on the configuration mentioned under `endpoints/**.json` file >> `request` key
- If a new configuration file is added under `endpoints/*` framework should automatically run the assertions as per mentioned in the configuration without writing an additional line of code
- You can use [reqres](https://reqres.in/) - to build and test this framework. Other API platforms are also acceptable





- You can use whatever directory/file structure you want, but there should be an `endpoints/` directory where we can post new endpoint
- Every line of code should be clean, well-commented, and self-explanatory. Code has to be scalable & maintainable in the long run.
