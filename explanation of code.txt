- used error handling using try-except blocks to handle exceptions that may occur during the execution
-inside the test_endpoint function, a try-except block is used to extract request details from the endpoint configuration.
-If any of the required keys ('request', 'method', 'url') are missing, a KeyError will be raised.
-again i have used try-except block to handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of HTTP
requests. If any error occurs during the request execution,
like invalid URLs, a requests.exceptions.
RequestException will be raised.
-assertions are performed to validate the response received
from the API. If any
assertion fails, a corresponding error message is printed.
test results are stored in a dictionary
 named test_results, which includes the URL, request method,
 status code, and response time for each endpoint.
 These results are then written to a JSON file named
'test_results.json' using the json.dump() function.
-ain function iterates through each JSON file in the
'endpoints/' directory, loads the endpoint configuration,
executes the test_endpoint function for each endpoint,
stores the test results, and logs the results to the
'test_results.json'
-a completion message "API tests are completed." is printed

# for using the script in future:
1)nsure that these dependencies are installed and up-to-date
2)if any changes in endpoints update JSON files in endpoints/ accordingly.
3)Review the test assertions

#if someone needs to add their api requests then?
1)Create a new JSON file
2)Place the newly created JSON file in the 'endpoints/'
3)Run the script as usual
4)eview the test results to verify the performance and behavior

#can i add few or more assertion except present in this scrpt?
1)include the additional assertions in the endpoint configuration JSON files located in the 'endpoints/' directory
2)extend the for loop to include checks for the new assertion keys
3)Add conditional statements to handle the new assertion keys
4)may need to update the structure of the test_results dictionary to accommodate related date
