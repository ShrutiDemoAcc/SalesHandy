Mysteps-

-created git repo
-required python library installed.here i will use request library and JSON library, time and os.
-requirement.txt downloaded
-config.py contain configurations URL or headers.
-utils for http request and assertions
-we can write test script in tests.

assumptions of code:

test_endpoint function-
this will take endpoint configuration as input and send resp http request.will validate the response.

main function= serves as a entry point for executing test.
will iterate on each jason file. and will call the test_endpoint function.

the script iterates through all JSON files in the src/endpoints/
here new endpoint configurations can be added without modifying the code.
Test results are stored in a dictionary for each endpoint configuration,

A small delay of 1 second is added
